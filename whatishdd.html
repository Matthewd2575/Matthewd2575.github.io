    HARD DISK DRIVE/SOLID STATE DRIVE (HDD/SDD)<br>
    <p>
      The hard drive commonly referred to as storage and is exactly what it means in that it stores information. There are many different<br>
      ways of storing information but for the sake of boredom we will just stick with common storage found internally inside a computer.<br>
      The more common types of storage that are found in todays computers are hard drive disk (HDD) and/or solid state drive. There<br>
      are some key differences as well as some postives and negatives to both. Hdd generally hold more storage, but are considerably<br>
      slower than ssd to read the information on the drive itself due to the fact that it is mechanical and has moving parts whereas an ssd does <br>
      not. Think of a record player and the arm that swings over to the record that plays music. Well, imagine 5-10 records stacked on top of <br>
      each other spinning extremely fast and the arms constantly and consistently moving back and forth searching for data written on the disk. That is <br>
      what is meant by mechanical. An ssd consists of integrated ciruits and microchips. Even though ssd are extremly fast with data transfer, one<br>
      drawback is that there are no warning signs of when an ssd might fail and the information considered to be lost forever. With hdd you can often<br>
      detect when it might begin to start failing and more often than not the data/information can be retrieved. There is no right or wrong kind of <br>
      of storage you use in your computer but you do need to ask yourself questions: do I want to access my information quickly, if the drive should fail<br>
      do I want the information recovered, how much storage do I really need, etc. When building a gaming computer you can use either/or hdd/ssd but <br>
      it is best practice to load your operating system on the ssd. Click on the picture to return to the parts page. :D
