    GRAPHIC PROCESSING UNIT (GPU)<br>
    <p>
      The graphics processing unit (GPU) or commonly referred to as the graphics card, is what generates the graphics that <br>
      appear on your monitor or television. Sometimes a GPU is integrated within the a CPU/MOTHERBOARD but nowadays there is <br>
      what known as a "dedicated graphics cards" in which these are essentially a computer within the computer itself. These dedicated <br>
      graphics cards have the ability to provide added on graphics/details such as shading, reflextions, ray tracing, rendering, and so on. <br>
      Dedicated graphics cards vary in price and can reach several thousands of dollars. In most cases of gaming computers, it is the most <br>
      expensive part within the computer. Do like to play your games like the origin Mario Bros on NES (choppy and pixelated) or do you like <br>
      to play your games with extreme graphical detail that almost mimics reality? Click on the picture to return to the parts page. :D
