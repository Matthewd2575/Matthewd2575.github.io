      <em>Instructions for Building a PC</em>
    </h1>
    <br />
    <p style="float:left\;">Step by Step Instructions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Step 1:</em>Do an inventory of your ordered parts and make sure that all parts are accounted for and unpackaged and ready for installation</li>
      <li><em>Step 2:</em>I recommend a clean area free of any liquid of any kind as as far away from carpet or possibly anything that might create static 
        electricity
      </li>
      <li><em>Step 3:</em>Attach your ground strap to one of your wrists and the ground lead to the computer case. This will prevent any static electricity to be 
        transfered to any electronic part that you might be handling might resulting in damaged circuits.
      </li>
      <li><em>Step 4:</em>I strongly recommend installing the cpu before installing the motherboard into the pc case. Both Intel and AMD cpu have very similar ways in 
        attaching the cpu to the motherboard in that there is a lever that needs to be flipped up. Once the lever is verticle, then install the cpu into the 
        socket. The cpu and socket have a little triangle on one of the corners and you will want to match those triangles and the cpu shoud just fall into place.
        If the cpu does not fall into place, I recommend just rotating the cpu 90 degrees clockwise each time until the cpu does "seat" on the socket. Once the cpu 
        is seated in the socket, slightly move the cpu around left/right and up/down. The cpu should only wiggle slightly. If it doesn't wiggle and just slides around, 
        the cpu is not seated. Once the cpu is seated, you can pull the lever down until it reaches the locking mechanism and then slight the lever over until it locks.
        If the lever folds back up or isn't in the locking position, the cpu again be damaged or the motherboard can be damaged.
      </li>
      <li><em>Step 5:</em>This next part is often the trickiest for me and that is mounting the motherboard into the pc case. First thing you will want to do is remove 
      the side panel on the pc case that will allow you to place the motherboard inside the pc case (pc cases have generally 2 side access panels and 1 panel is for maint/repairs
    to the motherboard/cpu side of the computer and the other side is generally where you will hide your wiring). At this point, lay the pc case flat on the other access panel
  that was not removed thus allowing you to just place the motherboard just inside the case temporarily. Now in your screw kit, there should be these brass looking screws called
motherboard standoff riser screws. If your pc case did not come with these already installed then you need to install the same number that correspnds with your motherboard (most often
times 5-9 is needed). After the proper number of these have been installed, the mother board should have came with a plate that needs to be installed inside the case prior to installing
motherboard. This plate should look very similar to the ports where you plug in your monitor, and usb mouse/keyboard. Usually it is labeled to show which way should be facing outwards. If 
not you will need to determine which was needs to face out and which way need to face in towards the motherbaord. This plate needs to be snapped from the inside of the pc case, so if you
snapped it on the outside, you need to remove and install from inside the pc case. You should feel this plate "snap" flat against the case and be fully seated. If it is not fully seated when
you go to mount the motherboard, you run the risk of damaging or warping the motherboard. Once this plate is properly secured, the motherboard can be placed inside the pc case ready for install.
At this point, I recommend getting your magnetic philips screwdriver and motherboard screws ready (the same number of screws as the standoff risers screws). You will need to place one hand
inside the pc case, putting slight pressure against the motherboard towards the rear of the pc case allowing the screw holes to align up. Start and only tighten each motherboard screw about 2-3 turns (do not tigten all
the way down until all screws have been started on riser screws). Once all motherboard screws have been started, I recommend working in an X pattern to tighten down the motherbaord screws. Some people
like to start in the middle and work their way ourwards in both directions. Either way will work honestly but I prefer the X pattern sometimes because threads won't strip and I find it honestly
easier to tighten the screws for some odd reason. Once all screws have reached their stopping point, I like to give each screw a nice little double check and make sure they are snug and not
overtightened. Remember the motherboard is plactic so you don't need to go incredible hulk and overtight these. Snug is just fine and may and smidge over snug but that's honestly the limit.</li>
      <li><em>Step 6:</em>At this point I like to install the power supply unit. If you bought a new power supply, these come as either non-modular, semi-modular or full modular. Do your research
      and find out which one you might want. The difference just has to deal with how many wires/cables are removeable and don't need to be installed. On the back of the pc case you will see 4 holes
    resembling in a trapezoidal shape. This is where the power supply bolt holes are. If your power supply did not come with the bolts, the kit has some. I like to leave the wire out (semi-modular/full modular)
  or if its non-modular zip tied until evertyhing is installed and ready for wiring. At this point, install your psu and make sure the bolt holes line up. Tighten all bolts to "snug".</li>
      <li><em>Step 7: </em>The next step I recommend is installing any other devices such as hard drives or cd/dvd-roms. If you do not know where they go, I recommed looking either in the manual that came with the case 
        or looking online. A lot of times, the hard drives are secured using plastic looking trays that you squeeze the tabs to remove the tray from the pc case (nvme or m.2 hard drive's bolt on the motherboard). CD/DVD roms
        usually bolt in from the sides. 
      </li>
      <li><em>Step 8: This next step can be the most confusing and intimidating aspect of the build. Wiring your computer. If you have any cd/dvd roms and non nvme/m.2 hard drives installed, you will need your sata cables. At
        this point remove the wire tie from your power supply or acquire all modulars wires. Now, most higher quality gaming power supplies label each one of their wires. The "cpu" connector refers to the 2/4pin connector on the motherboard,
        the "mobo" is the largest 20/24-pin connector that plugs into the motherboard, "sata" refers to any and all components using requiring sata power (cd/dvd rom and hard drives), and "pci-e" which refers the connector for the 
        graphics card installed to the pci-e slot on the motherboard. Depending on the pc case, there will also be wires for the power switch, reset switch, cpu indicator light, hard drive indicator light, and front usb ports that need to be hooked up as well
        Now I cannot tell you how to route your wiring because there are many different ways of doing this, but the general rule of thumb is the less wiring showing, the more professional the build appears. Remember, many people like their gaming computers
        to look as good as they perform. For learning how to route your wiring, I recommend looking at other builds that people have done to get an idea of what you want to do and how to do it. I do recommend the use of wire ties or zip ties to properly 
        secure any and all wiring so that it doesn't rub/or short out against your pc case. If you are confused on which wires go where, I recommend possibly watching a tutorial on either youtube or any number of pc building forums. These are great resources
        in giving visual people like myself visual image so that you can continue on.
