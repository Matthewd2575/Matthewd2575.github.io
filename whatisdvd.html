    DIGITAL VIDEO/VERSATILE DISC (DVD)<br>
    <p>
      With the advancement of technology in computers, comes advancements in other areas of life such as data storage. <br>
      In this section we will not cover hard drives since it has its own section. For many years, computers used to use<br>
      what many refer to as a floppy disk 3.5 or 5.25 inch formats. Because computers back in the 70's, 80's, and early 90's<br>
      didn't have an operating system nor a hard drive to help control and load software, software and games were loaded onto a floppy disk <br>
      and so you would load the disk into a drive where the process of magnetic encoding would take place (read or write information)<br>
      on the disk. Fast forward a few years and enters into the market CD's and DVD's. I'm sure many of us know what a cd/dvd is<br>
      but for those who don't know a CD-ROM (compact disc-read only memory) or DVD-ROM(digital video disc-read only memory) <br>
      is another format of storage kind of like smaller lp record or a laserdisc(even bigger dvd!). The ROM part in the name refers <br>
      to player that is able to read the disk using beams of light to read the information on the disc. We still use these formats<br>
      but are used mainly for entertainment such as movies and are less practical for "storing data". In todays society, it's <br>
      practical to use either what is known as a portable external hard drive or a usb thumbdrive since since the amount of storage<br>
      these hold is equivalent to several stacks of CDs/DVDs. Click on the picture to return back to the parts page. :D
