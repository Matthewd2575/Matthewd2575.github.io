      Shopping and Preparation<br>
      <p>
        Before we begin to start building our PC, shopping for the components/parts and be a little bit of a hastle and often times<br>
        very intimidating but fear not for I will give you some great pointers and guide you through the process. Now when it comes to <br>
        gaming pc parts, like many products on the market today there are certain brands that are consider high-tier, mid-tier, and bottom-tier<br>
        brands. For instance (and for the record this is just my personal opinion), a few high-tier brands when it comes to gaming pc parts<br>
        include brands such as Nvidia, EVGA, and ASUS. Mid-tier brands include brands such as MSI, Gigabyte, and ASRock and bottom-tier brands <br>
        include Intel, Acer, Dell, and Biostar. Now I will say some brands excel at certain parts even though they may be consider a mid-tier or <br>
        bottom-tier. An example is MSI and their parts. MSI makes a breat motherboard but their graphics cards are often very flimsy and fragile. <br>
        Another thing to consider when building a gaming pc is a budget. More often than not, your top-tier parts will be anywhere from about 10-25%<br>
        more expensive and may perform exactly the same as a mid-tier brand. The last thing you need to consider is how do you know if all of these <br>
        parts will fit and/or compatible with each other. Well you are in luck because there are websites such as <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/">
        https://pcpartpicker.com/list/</a> or <br><a href="https://buildmypc.net/">https://buildmypc.net/ </a> that will check your compatibility to 
        make sure your parts will not only fit physically together but will also perform <br>and be compatible with each other (not create lag or bottlenecking).
        The biggest piece of advice that I can offer build a pc that fits YOUR needs and do <br>your research. There are plenty of resources on the internet
        that will provide valuable information and it may take several hours or even days to <br> to figure what's best for your wants/needs based on 
        your budget. Now with that being said LET'S GET BUILDING!!!!!!!!!!! :D
