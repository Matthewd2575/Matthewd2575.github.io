    DESKTOP/TOWER (PC CASE)<br>
    <p>
      The desktop or commonly referred to as the tower or case, is exactly what it sounds like. It is the shell that physically<br>
      holds everything together with screws or wire ties. This is where you will often screw your mobo, fans/water cooling, hdd/sdd,<br>
      and psu. PC cases come in various shapes and sizes and depending on your wants/needs they are several options on the market.<br>
      PC cases can come as just a case or sometimes can include fans already installed. PC cases also vary in size: big and monstrous<br>
      or small like the size of and Xbox/Playstation. They can come as plain as the day or can come with tempered glass so you can see <br>
      the interworkings as well as your fancy l.e.d. or rgb lighting. Click on the picture to return to the parts page. :D
