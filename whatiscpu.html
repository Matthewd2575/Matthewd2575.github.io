    CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT (CPU)<br>
    <p>
      The central processing unit or CPU for short, is considered the most important processor within a computer.<br>
       This processor is what performs the actual computational/logic work and controlling input/output operations. <br>
       The components of a CPU are very complex and consists of integrated circuits, microprocessors, registers, buses, <br>
       cache, arithmetic logic unit and control unit. It is considered to be the "brain" of the computer. <br>
       In today's market, the two largest manufacturers of CPU processors are INTEL and AMD. I strongly recommend <br>
       researching the differences each manufacturer has to offer in their processors as they are different in their <br>
       own ways and are often geared towards one thing or another. AMD/RYZEN processors in my opinion are designed <br> 
       primarily for multitasking where as INTEL processors are designed primarily for single tasks. If you plan to <br>
       game, listen to music, edit videos, graphic design, and watch youtube all at once I highly recommend going to towards <br>
       a RYZEN/AMD processor. If you just want to perform single tasks 1 maybe 2 at a time like <em>JUST</em> gaming or surfing the <br>
       internet or watching a movie or editing music I strongly would recommend an INTEL processor. Basically it comes down to your <br>
       needs and what you want out of your computer. Click on the picture to return to the parts page. :D
