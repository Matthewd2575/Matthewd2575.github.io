    RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY (RAM)<br>
    <p>
      Random access memory is the temporary storage that the cpu often uses to load data instead of contantly searching for it on the hdd/ssd.<br>
      Ram is what is considered as "short-term" memory in that ram gives applications a place to store and access data on a short-term basis.<br>
      Everytime you power down your computer, your ram is cleared out where as on a hdd/sdd when powered down the information stays on the drive.<br>
      If you intend to use a lot of software/applications at one time or applications that require signicant amounts of ram, it's best to try to <br>
      as much and as fast ram as your motherboard can sustain. If your intentions are single task oriented such as just gaming or surfing the web<br>
      from time to time, massive amounts of ram and speed is not as crucial and your money might be spend better else where (at least if you intend)<br>
      to build a gaming pc such as a faster cpu or better gpu. Click on the picture to return back to the parts page. :D
