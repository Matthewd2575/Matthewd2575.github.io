    MOTHERBOARD (MOBO)<br>
    <p>
      The motherboard is essentially the central nervous system of a computer. It connects everything together. On the motherboard itself<br>
      you will find other parts such as the cpu, ram, gpu (dedicated only) and sometimes nvme ssd (if equipped). Sometimes the hdd/ssd is <br>
      connected through sata cables which are then connected to the motherboard. The mobo is a very integral part a computer. The motherboard <br>
      is able to take your input from keyboard/mouse/touchscreen and relay that input to the cpu and from there the cpu is able to logically<br>
      or arithmetically perform its tasks as needed. Without a motherboard, you would have just a bunch of random/useless parts worth absolutely<br>
      nothing. The mobo connects the case, psu, ram, cpu, gpu, fans/cooling, cd/dvd-rom, and hdd/ssd as all one unit so you can see how crucial<br>
      a mobo really is when building a computer. Click on the picture to return to the parts page. :D
