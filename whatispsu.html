    POWER SUPPLY UNIT (PSU)<br>
    <p>
     The Power Supply Unit or PSU for short is what provides the power from the outlet in your wall to your computer. Inside your<br>
     computer the psu directly powers the mobo, the cpu, cd/dvd-rom, hdd/sdd and sometimes the fans/watercooling. PSUs come in <br>
     different wattage ranges. Your basic computer in today's world often uses between 300w-500w depending on certain aspects of<br>
     computer such as type of processor, fans/watercooling (how man fans), dedicated gpu, how many hdd/ssd are in use, etc. Depending<br>
     on how you build your computer, many gaming computers require a minimum of 500w of power up to somestimes 1400w. If you are lost<br>
     or unsure of how much wattage you might need, there are several online resources that provide a wattage calculator assuming you know <br>
     the parts you intend to use and it will calculate how much wattage is needed. For me, when I'm building a custom computer I like to <br>
     about 100w more than what is recommended since there might be the potential for future upgrades. Just seems silly to me that if you<br>
     use the exact amount of wattage and you want to upgrade sometime in the future you will have to upgrade your psu as well. Why not spend<br>
     an extra $5-$10 now as opposed to an additional $70-$150 further down the road? Click on the picture to return to the parts page. :D
