    FAN/WATER COOLING <br>
    <p>
      When it comes to cooling down a computer there are 2 different ways of doing this and that is water/liquid cooled or air cooled. <br>
      There really isn't a right or wrong way to cool down a processor but there is in fact a recommended way of cooling down your computer. <br>
      If you intend to overclock your processor and graphics card, pushing them to their max limits it is strongly recommended that you <br>
      consider liguid/water cooling as this provides a more effective way of not melting things. If you don't intend or don't have a processor <br>
      that is capable of overclocking, air cooled is usually sufficient enough to not melt the different components within your computer. One <br>
      thing to remember when air cooling a computer is you want cold air to come in and hot air to escape, which means your fans need to be<br>
      directed in a specific direction and it is very easy to get the direction of "air flow" confused which can lead to premature failure of parts <br>
      due to insufficient cooling over time. Click on the picture to return to the parts page. :D
